This Next.js application is a Face Expression Detection app that includes two main components:

mood-detection – Responsible for detecting and interpreting facial expressions to identify the user's mood.

live-detection – Handles real-time face expression tracking using the device's camera for a live detection experience.

Together, these modules provide an interactive and dynamic user experience by analyzing facial expressions both statically and in real time.
